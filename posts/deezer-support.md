# deezer support

Medium would probably be a better platform for blogging. But you know what? Screw it. I know the Github platform well and I use it every day. Less is more.

Oh, and I can write in **markdown**. And use emojis. üòª I‚Äôm all set.

Songlink launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/songlink-2-0) the other day, and we had fun monitoring the spike in traffic to the site and engaging with the community. We received a ton of feedback, almost 90% of which actually made sense üòú.

A few people requested support for Deezer, and we delivered! Deezer is now an option on every Songlink page. If you‚Äôre a Deezer user, simply click the `Listen on Deezer` button and you should be redirected to the song in the Deezer app (on mobile) or Deezer web app (on desktop).

If you‚Äôd like to share a song from Deezer, create a Songlink by simply grabbing the song‚Äôs url and appending it to https://songlink.io, like this:

https://songlink.io/https://www.deezer.com/track/66539325

We are working on incorporating some of other the feedback we have received, so stay tuned for more updates. And, as always, please reach out to us via [email](hello@songlink.io) or hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/songlinkio).
